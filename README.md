- **python**
  - basics (variables, data types, operators, etc.)
  - functions (functions, lambda functions, etc.)
  - data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, etc.)
  - classes (classes, objects, inheritance, etc.)
- **Poetry** integration for python dependency handler
- **Conda** integration for python environment management
- python Web Server with **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn**
- python DS (Data Science):
  - **Pandas**
  - **Numpy**
  - **Matplotlib**
  - **Seaborn**
  - **Jupyter**
  - **Scikit-learn**
- python LLM (Large Language Model):
  - **Promptflow**
  - **Langchain**
  - **Autogen**

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed and provisioned:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)


**Python** is a programming language that is actively developed and has a large community. It is used for web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.

**Poetry** is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

**Conda** is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies.

**Docker** is a platform that enables developers to build, package, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and learn, and it is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.

## Setup

To initialize the project, you'll need to create a `.env` file at the root of each folder. 

This file should contain all of the environment variables required by the project. Use the `.env.example` file as a template.

The dependencies for the project are managed using Poetry.


## üíª Running Locally

1. Install dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and activate virtual environmentüî®

2. If you don't have poetry installed, you can install it with `pip install poetry`.
3. Add `poetry` to your path.
4. Move to the project directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# To check if poetry is installed [Tested with 1.6.1]
poetry --version

# To reevaluate the dependencies
poetry lock

# To install the dependencies
poetry install --no-root

# Setup the environment variables
mv ./src/env.example ./src/.env

# To activate the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

5. Select the chapter

```bash
cd ./10-web-uvicorn
# Setup libraries *(not mandatory)
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

# Run the FastAPI server
cd ./10-web-uvicorn/src
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

6. Display the API documentation

   - Open the following links in your browser to view the API documentation by using ReDoc

     - [ReDoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

   - Open the following links in your browser to view the API documentation by using the Swagger UI

     - [Swagger UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

## üíª Running with Docker

To run the project with docker, execute the following command:

```bash
#docker build
docker build -t web-uvicorn ./10-web-uvicorn/.

# Run the docker container with container name and port mapping
docker run -d --name web-uvicorn_01 -p 8200:8000 web-uvicorn
```

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## üìù Testing

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
# Run the tests
pytest
```

## üöÄ Deployment

To deploy the project, you'll need to follow the steps below:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your server.
2. Clone the project repository on your server.
3. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the required environment variables.
4. Run the following command to start the project:
